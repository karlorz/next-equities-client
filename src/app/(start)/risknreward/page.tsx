          metrics into Next-Equities, a web app designed to provide a
          comprehensive evaluation of your investment portfolio. Unlike other

          CAR25, or Compound Annual Rate of Return at the 25th percentile,
          enables effective comparisons between investment options by
          considering risk-normalized profit potential. By focusing on
          conservative return estimates, CAR25 supports informed decision-making
          when allocating funds.

          promoting prudent investment management.
