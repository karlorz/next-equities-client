## Perform Metric for Stock Portfolio
## Motivation
Providing a comprehensive approach to evaluating the risk and rewards of investment portfolio. While most metric tools only present risk and rewards separately, I need a system combines these factors to give view of portfolio's performance.
## Expected result
At the watchlist page, you can add, edit, delete and compute the perform metric. For demo, I typical select CAR25 from the book of Dr. Howard Bandy - Quantitative Technical Analysist. Also compute the Correlation coefficient to the market, preset to "spy".

* Equity Curve at Safe F.

## Terms

CAR25 is a conservative metric that can be used to compare alternative uses of funds.  It is the compound annual rate of return for the risk normalized profit at the 25th percentile of the distribution

SAFEF is the fixed percentage position size at the trade system.

## Assumptions and Limitations

During calculation, assume:
* the position sizing can be more than 100% of account, maximum is 400%,
* 0 interest rate,
* buy with fixed fractional position sizing every trades everyday,
* commission omit
